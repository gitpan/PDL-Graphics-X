        Figured out how to make X close only one window (rather 
           then all the windows) when you clicked the close box with
           the mouse.
        Figured out how to trap broken pipe errors caused by severing
           X client/server connections.

	  Sun Mar 27 2005
	    Reorganized xs functions so that they are now alphabetical
	    Added (lame) support of drawing rotated text. Its not actually 
	      rotated, just drawn along a rotated baseline.
	    Added error handling to cursor so that if the user clicked on
	      the window and closed it all would not be lost.
